# Neural-Networks

Text Classifier Project
The goal of this project is to design a neural network model that accurately classifies text data into different categories. After experimenting with several architectures, we chose to use transformers because they delivered the highest accuracy on our dataset. Additionally, transformers showed the best ability to generalize across both categories we needed to classify.
